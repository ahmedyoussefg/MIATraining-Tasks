# M.I.A Training Phase - Tasks:
## <strong>Task 1:</strong>
- It consists of 4 subtasks and had 4 bonus tasks. It was a great way to apply your knowledge in C and programming basics. In the last subtask I applied the equations of Kalman Filter and the kinematics equations to predict the measurements of the two sensors.
## <strong>Task 2:</strong> 
- It consists of 2 subtasks and one bonus task. We were required to design two circuits on a circuit-simulation program. We were required to make a research on BMS (Battery Management Systems).
## <strong>Task 3:</strong>
- In task 3, we were required to use our knowledge in Arduino codes to simulate two circuits. We were also required to make a research on SLAM. We made a code that solves the well-known localization problem.
## <strong>Task 4:</strong>
- In task 4, we applied the OOP principles of Python to build a game that has multiple villians and gadgets. The game simulates a fight between two villians and prints the output of every fight. It can be used to train a model to predict who can win the fight. In the second subtask, we made a LinearRegression Model that predicts data of a data set. In the end, we made a plot that compares the actual results with the predicted results.
## <strong>Task 5:</strong>
- In task 5, I got to explore the Linux OS and Git commands. I installed Ubuntu OS on VirtualBox and made a mark-down documentations for the commands I used.
## <strong>Task 6:</strong>
- In task 6, we got to know about Sensors like MPU6050 and how to interface with them. We also learnt about Technical Documentation and got our hands to try working on Notion and LateX.
